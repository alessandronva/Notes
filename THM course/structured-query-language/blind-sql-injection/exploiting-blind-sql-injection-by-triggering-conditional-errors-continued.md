# Exploiting blind SQL injection by triggering conditional errors - Continued

To see how this works, suppose that two requests are sent containing the following `TrackingId` cookie values in turn:

`EXAMPLE:1 xyz' AND (SELECT CASE WHEN (1=2) THEN 1/0 ELSE 'a' END)='a`&#x20;

`EXAMPLE:2 xyz' AND (SELECT CASE WHEN (1=1) THEN 1/0 ELSE 'a' END)='a`

These inputs use the `CASE` keyword to test a condition and return a different expression depending on whether the expression is true:

* With the first input, the `CASE` expression evaluates to `'a'`, which does not cause any error.
* With the second input, it evaluates to `1/0`, which causes a divide-by-zero error.

If the error causes a difference in the application's HTTP response, you can use this to determine whether the injected condition is true.

Using this technique, you can retrieve data by testing one character at a time:

`xyz' AND (SELECT CASE WHEN (Username = 'Administrator' AND SUBSTRING(Password, 1, 1) > 'm') THEN 1/0 ELSE 'a' END FROM Users)='a`

**Note**

There are different ways of triggering conditional errors, and different techniques work best on different database types. For more details, see the [SQL injection cheat sheet](https://portswigger.net/web-security/sql-injection/cheat-sheet).
