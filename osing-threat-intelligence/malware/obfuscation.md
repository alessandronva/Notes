# Obfuscation

### Theory:

Packing is one form of obfuscation that malware Authors employ to prevent the analysis of programmes. There are both legitimate and malicious reasons as to why the Author of a program will want to prevent the decompiling of their program.&#x20;

For example, a legitimate reason is the protection of intellectual property! Whilst I'm one for open-source as much as the next person here - alas not every organisation has the same mindset...but let's leave that aside.

In the same token, just because you write a program...Why should everyone have the right to "copy" your project? This is one of the justifiable reasons for obfuscation - it is yours at the end of the day!&#x20;

However, malware Authors employ obfuscation techniques such as packing - whilst for the same reasons, they do so with the intent to prevent people like us reversing it to understand its behaviours and ultimately with the aims of achieving infection.
