# Yara vs PE explorer

1. **PE Explorer**:
   * PE Explorer is a software analysis tool specifically designed for examining and editing Windows executable files (PE files), such as EXE, DLL, and SYS files.
   * It provides a graphical interface for exploring the internal structure of PE files, including headers, sections, resources, imports, exports, and more.
   * PE Explorer allows users to view and edit various aspects of PE files, such as modifying resource data, patching binary code, and extracting embedded files.
   * It also offers features for analyzing and debugging executable files, including disassembly and dependency scanning.
2. **YARA**:
   * YARA is a pattern matching tool and a rule-based language designed for identifying and categorizing malware and other types of files based on their characteristics and behavior.
   * Unlike PE Explorer, YARA is not limited to analyzing executable files; it can be used to analyze any type of file or data.
   * YARA rules consist of patterns and conditions that describe specific features or behaviors of interest, allowing analysts to create custom rules to detect known malware families, suspicious behaviors, or other indicators of compromise.
   * YARA can be used in a variety of cybersecurity scenarios, including malware detection, threat hunting, incident response, and malware research.
