# Before doing malware analysis

* Never analyze malware or suspected malware on a machine that does not have the sole purpose of analyzing malware.
* When not analyzing or moving malware samples around to different locations, always keep them in password-protected zip/rar or other archives so that we can avoid accidental detonation.
* Only extract the malware from this password-protected archive inside the isolated environment, and only when analyzing it.
* Create an isolated VM specifically for malware analysis, which has the capability of being reverted to a clean slate once you are done.
* Ensure that all internet connections are closed or at least monitored.
* Once you are done with malware analysis, revert the VM to its clean slate for the next malware analysis session to avoid residue from a previous malware execution corrupting the next one.
