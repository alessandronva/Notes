# Ghidra concept

Ghidra is not specifically a PE tool; rather, it is a powerful software reverse engineering framework developed by the National Security Agency (NSA). Ghidra supports the analysis of various executable file formats, including Portable Executable (PE) files, which are the standard executable format for Windows operating systems.

While Ghidra is capable of analyzing PE files, it is not limited to them. It can handle a wide range of binary formats, including executables, object files, firmware, and more, from different platforms and architectures. Ghidra provides a comprehensive set of features for reverse engineering, including disassembly, decompilation, code analysis, scripting, and collaboration.

In the context of PE analysis, Ghidra offers capabilities similar to those of dedicated PE tools, allowing users to inspect and manipulate various aspects of PE files, such as headers, sections, imports, exports, resources, and more. Additionally, Ghidra's scripting support enables users to automate analysis tasks and customize their workflows for analyzing PE files and other binary formats.

In summary, while Ghidra is not exclusively a PE tool, it is a versatile reverse engineering framework that includes support for analyzing PE files among its many features.
