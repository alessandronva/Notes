# Static vs Dynamic analysis

There are two categories used when analysing malware, these are:

### 1. Static Analysis

### 2. Dynamic Analysis

Whilst the methods and tools used for these two categories are vastly different, they are essential in compositing an understanding of how a malware behaves.

### Static Analysis.

At its brief, "Static Analysis" is used to gain a high-level abstraction of the sample - it can be fairly simple to decide if a piece of code is "malicious" or not with this method alone (but not always, this will be discussed later...). At its core, this method is of the analysis of the sample at the state it presents itself as, without executing the code.

Employing the use of techniques such as signature analysis via checksums means quick, efficient (albeit extremely brief) and safe analysis of malware.

### Dynamic Analysis

This step is a lot more involved, and is where the abstraction of the sample is largely built upon. "Dynamic Analysis" essentially involves executing the sample and observing what happens. This of course is not safe. If the sample turns out to be "Ransomware" - you've now lost your files. If it is capable of propagating via traversing a network, nice...You've now just infected your Local Area Network (LAN).
