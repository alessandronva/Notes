1. **File Hashes**: Unique identifiers generated from the contents of files, such as MD5, SHA-1, or SHA-256 hashes. These can be used to identify known malware or malicious files.
2. **IP Addresses**: Suspicious or known malicious IP addresses associated with command-and-control servers, malicious hosts, or malicious traffic.
3. **Domain Names**: Suspicious or known malicious domain names used for phishing, malware distribution, or command-and-control purposes.
4. **URLs**: Suspicious or known malicious URLs used in phishing emails, malicious advertisements, or drive-by download attacks.
5. **Email Addresses**: Suspicious or known malicious email addresses used in phishing campaigns or as contact points for attackers.
6. **Registry Keys**: Anomalies or changes to registry keys on Windows systems that may indicate malware persistence or unauthorized changes.
7. **Mutex Names**: Named system objects used by malware for synchronization or interprocess communication. Unusual or suspicious mutex names may indicate malware presence.
8. **File Paths**: Anomalies or suspicious file paths on systems, such as unusual file locations or unexpected changes to system files.
9. **Network Traffic Patterns**: Unusual or suspicious network traffic patterns, such as unusual port usage, spikes in data transfer, or communication with known malicious IP addresses.
10. **Behavioral Indicators**: Anomalous or suspicious behaviors observed on systems or networks, such as unusual processes, privilege escalations, or changes to system configurations.
11. **User Account Anomalies**: Anomalies or suspicious activities associated with user accounts, such as multiple failed login attempts, unusual login times, or changes to user permissions.
12. **Command-Line Parameters**: Unusual or suspicious command-line parameters used in system commands or processes that may indicate malicious activity.
13. **File Metadata**: Anomalies or suspicious metadata associated with files, such as unusual file creation dates, authors, or digital signatures.
14. **YARA Signatures**: Custom or known YARA signatures used to detect specific patterns or characteristics of malware or malicious files.
15. **DNS Queries**: Anomalies or suspicious DNS queries, such as DNS requests for known malicious domains or unusual domain resolution patterns.

By monitoring and analyzing these indicators of compromise, security teams can detect and respond to security incidents more effectively, minimizing the impact of cyber threats on their organization's systems and data.
