# Abuse.ch

[Abuse.ch](https://abuse.ch/) is a research project hosted by the Institue for Cybersecurity and Engineering at the Bern University of Applied Sciences in Switzerland. It was developed to identify and track malware and botnets through several operational platforms developed under the project. These platforms are:

* **Malware Bazaar:**  A resource for sharing malware samples.
* **Feodo Tracker:**  A resource used to track botnet command and control (C2) infrastructure linked with Emotet, Dridex and TrickBot.
* **SSL Blacklist:**  A resource for collecting and providing a blocklist for malicious SSL certificates and JA3/JA3s fingerprints.
* **URL Haus:**  A resource for sharing malware distribution sites.
* **Threat Fox:**  A resource for sharing indicators of compromise (IOCs).

Let us look into these platforms individually.

### [MalwareBazaar](https://bazaar.abuse.ch/)

As the name suggests, this project is an all in one malware collection and analysis database. The project supports the following features:

* Malware Samples Upload: Security analysts can upload their malware samples for analysis and build the intelligence database. This can be done through the browser or an API.
* **Malware Hunting:** Hunting for malware samples is possible through setting up alerts to match various elements such as tags, signatures, YARA rules, ClamAV signatures and vendor detection.
