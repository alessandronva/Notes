# OpenCTI

Cyber Threat Intelligence is typically a managerial mystery to handle, with organisations battling with how to input, digest, analyse and present threat data in a way that will make sense. From the rooms that have been linked on the overview, it is clear that there are numerous platforms that have been developed to tackle the juggernaut that is Threat Intelligence.

#### OpenCTI

[OpenCTI](https://github.com/OpenCTI-Platform/opencti) is another open-sourced platform designed to provide organisations with the means to manage CTI through the storage, analysis, visualisation and presentation of threat campaigns, malware and IOCs.\


#### Objective

Developed by the collaboration of the [French National cybersecurity agency (ANSSI)](https://www.ssi.gouv.fr/), the platform's main objective is to create a comprehensive tool that allows users to capitalise on technical and non-technical information while developing relationships between each piece of information and its primary source. The platform can use the [MITRE ATT\&CK framework](https://tryhackme.com/room/mitre) to structure the data. Additionally, it can be integrated with other threat intel tools such as MISP and TheHive. Rooms to these tools have been linked in the overview.\
