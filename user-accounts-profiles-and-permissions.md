# User Accounts, Profiles, and Permissions

User accounts can be one of two types on a typical local Windows system: Administrator & Standard User.&#x20;

The user account type will determine what actions the user can perform on that specific Windows system.&#x20;

* An Administrator can make changes to the system: add users, delete users, modify groups, modify settings on the system, etc.&#x20;
* A Standard User can only make changes to folders/files attributed to the user & can't perform system-level changes, such as install programs.

You are currently logged in as an Administrator. There are several ways to determine which user accounts exist on the system.&#x20;

One way is to click the `Start Menu` and type `Other User`. A shortcut to `System Settings > Other users` should appear.&#x20;

If you click on it, a Settings window should now appear. See below.

Since you're the Administrator, you see an option to Add someone else to this PC.

Note: A Standard User will not see this option. &#x20;

Click on the local user account. More options should appear: Change account type and Remove.&#x20;

Click on Change account type. The value in the drop-down box (or the highlighted value if you click the drop-down) is the current account type.&#x20;

When a user account is created, a profile is created for the user. The location for each user profile folder will fall under is C:\Users.

For example, the user profile folder for the user account Max will be C:\Users\Max.

The creation of the user's profile is done upon initial login. When a new user account logs in to a local system for the first time, they'll see several messages on the login screen. One of the messages, User Profile Service, sits on the login screen for a while, which is at work creating the user profile. See below.

Once logged in, the user will see a dialog box similar to the one below (again), indicating that the profile is in creation.

Each user profile will have the same folders; a few of them are:

* Desktop
* Documents
* Downloads
* Music
* Pictures

Another way to access this information, and then some, is using Local User and Group Management.&#x20;

Right-click on the Start Menu and click Run. Type `lusrmgr.msc`. See below

Note: The Run Dialog Box allows us to open items quickly.&#x20;

Back to lusrmgr, you should see two folders: Users and Groups.&#x20;

If you click on Groups, you see all the names of the local groups along with a brief description for each group.&#x20;

Each group has permissions set to it, and users are assigned/added to groups by the Administrator. When a user is assigned to a group, the user inherits the permissions of that group. A user can be assigned to multiple groups.

Note: If you click on Add someone else to this PC from Other users, it will open Local Users and Management.&#x20;
